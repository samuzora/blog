## whoami

Hi üëã I'm Lucas Tan, a Singaporean JC2 student at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACSI) and current chairman of ACSI
Coding Competition Team (CCT).

I love playing and winning CTFs, having achieved top positions in both local and international CTFs, like Lag and Crash,
Cyberthon, Codegate Junior and others. Always excited to play more üòã

Besides playing, I've also organized and hosted 3 iterations of HACK@AC from 2021 to 2024, and set many challenges for
other CTFs, including [HackTM 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1848), [Cyberleague 2022
Quarterfinals](https://cyberleague.co/), and other smaller local CTFs like BlahajCTF, Sieberrsec, Whitehacks and more.

Etymology of samuzora: ÂØíÁ©∫ in Japanese (is super cringe ü´†)

### ctfs

I main pwn and web with decent experience in both, but always looking to laern more üòÉ Also learning smart contract, and
can do a bit of RE and misc. but will never touch crypto or forens

I'm also a member of <https://wrecktheline.com> with so many amazing and super teammates to learn from ‚ù§Ô∏è

### other stuff

When I'm not busy solving challenges, I like to do a bit of web dev. I'm quite familiar with Next.js and Prisma stack.
(but my frontend is super ugly)

Also a huge fan of neovim (my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/samuzora/dotfiles)!)
