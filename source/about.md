I'm Lucas Tan, a Singaporean JC2 student at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACSI) and chairman of ACSI
Coding Competition Team (CCT) from 2022 to 2024.

I love playing and winning CTFs, having achieved top positions in both local and international CTFs, like Lag and Crash,
Cyberthon, Codegate Junior and others. Always excited to play more :D

Besides playing, I've also organized and hosted 3 iterations of HACK@AC from 2021 to 2024, and set many challenges for
other CTFs, including [HackTM 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1848), [Cyberleague 2022
Quarterfinals](https://cyberleague.co/), and other smaller local CTFs like BlahajCTF, Sieberrsec, Whitehacks and more.

I main pwn and web with decent experience in both, but always looking to learn more! I'm also learning smart contract,
and can do a bit of RE and misc. But I'll never touch crypto or forens. I'm currently learning kernel pwn and v8 :)

I'm also a member of <https://wrecktheline.com> with many amazing and pro teammates to learn from.
