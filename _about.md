# about

konnichiwassup! I'm Lucas Tan, a 17 year old high school student at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). I'm currently studying PCME and will be taking my IBDP exam in 2024.

In my high school, I'm the vice-chair of the Robotics Technology Society, and lead my juniors in ctfs or other app dev projects.

I'm also a member of [WreckTheLine](https://ctftime.org/team/57908), one of the top 10 ctf teams globally on <https://ctftime.org>.

I main web and pwn in ctfs, and maybe anything else that might involve RCE of some sort.
