Hi!! Welcome to my blog~ You can find my CTF writeups and other
cybersecurity-related stuff here!

I'm Lucas Tan, an 18-year-old student from Singapore. I've recently graduated
from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and am waiting to enlist in National
Service. I love playing CTFs and pwning stuff :)

I main pwn and web, and currently learning kernel pwn, v8, and blockchain.

My CTF teams:

- [WreckTheLine](https://ctftime.org/team/57908)

Open to team invites, please DM me on Discord!

Besides playing, I've also organized HACK@AC 2022 and 2024, and set challenges
for some other CTFs.
