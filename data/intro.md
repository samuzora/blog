Hi!! Welcome to my blog~ You can find my CTF writeups and other
cybersecurity-related stuff here!

I'm Lucas Tan, an 18-year-old student from Singapore. I'm currently studying
PCME at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). I love playing CTFs and pwning stuff
:)

I'm currently a member of WreckTheLine and not looking for a team at the moment.
I occasionally play CTFs with some of my other Singaporean friends under
slight_smile.

At the moment, I'm maining pwn and web, and learning blockchain, kernel pwn and
v8 pwn.

Besides playing, I've also organized HACK@AC 2022 and 2024, and set challenges
for some other CTFs. Feel free to PM me on DIscord if you'd like me to set some
pwn challenges!
